In this challenge, I developed an application to manage a shopping cart for a fictional coffee shop, which includes the following features:

Listing of products (coffees) available for purchase
Adding a specific quantity of items to the cart
Increasing or decreasing the quantity of items in the cart
Form for the user to fill in their address
Displaying the total number of items in the cart in the Header
Displaying the total value of the items in the cart multiplied by the unit price
Displaying form information.
In this project, I used Styled Components, React Router, React Hook Form, as well as React hooks such as useContext, useState, and useEffect.
